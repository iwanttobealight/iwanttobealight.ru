in programming exist concept of duck-typing. If some `X` looks and behaves like duck we consider it a duck. Frequently, it works well. 
Also, I noticed that it works in the real life. 

for example — if I know some clever person, I trust her in her field of knowledge. If someone has her own business, I suppose that this person is responsible. She is doing mature things for mature reasons. Keeps promises. Even if that person sometimes behaves impulsively and rashly, I thought — it's my misunderstanding. 

But it wasn't. It was like it seems — irresponsible and careless acts. 
I was wrong. I didn't listen to my intuition.

if something (external) seems wrong — it's probably wrong. (things in my head lives by different laws)

i have to less listen to others and more trust myself
